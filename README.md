# ROS-Navigation-Stack
**ROS Navigation Stack Package for Custom 4-Wheel Drive Robot with AMCL Algorithm**

  This repository contains a ROS (Robot Operating System) package for implementing navigation capabilities on a custom 4-wheel drive robot using the Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) algorithm. 
  This README file provides an overview of the package, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

**1. Introduction**

  This ROS package is designed to enable autonomous navigation for a 4-wheel drive robot. It utilizes the AMCL algorithm to estimate the robot's pose within a map, allowing it to navigate to specified goals while avoiding obstacles.
  The package includes configuration files, launch files, and scripts necessary for integrating AMCL-based navigation into your robot system.

**3. Prerequisites**

  Before using this package, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up:

  ROS noetic or a compatible ROS distribution.
  Gazebo for simulating the robot (if applicable).
  A working ROS workspace for your robot project.

**3. Installation**

  To install this package, follow these steps:

**Clone this repository into your ROS workspace:**

  `cd /path/to/your/ros/catkin_ws/src`
  
  `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`

**Build the ROS package:**

   `catkin_make`

**Source your ROS workspace:**

  `source devel/setup.bash`
  
**4. Usage**

**Launching Navigation Stack**
 
  To launch the navigation stack with AMCL, use the provided launch file:

  `roslaunch rmp01_bot_description navigation.launch`

  This launch file will start the necessary nodes and configure the robot for navigation.

**Teleoperation (Optional)**

  You can teleoperate the robot for testing purposes using the following command:

  `rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py`

**Setting Navigation Goals**

  To send navigation goals to the robot, you can use tools like RViz or send navigation goals programmatically using ROS messages.

**Visualizing in RViz**

  Launch RViz to visualize the robot's path and sensor data:
 
  `roslaunch rmp01_bot_description rviz.launch`

  In RViz, you can set navigation goals, monitor the AMCL localization, and visualize the robot's perception.

**5. Customization**

  This package is designed as a starting point for your custom robot. You can customize various parameters in configuration files to adapt the navigation stack to your specific robot's hardware and sensors.

**Configuration Files**
 
 config/local_costmap.yaml-- Parameters for the local costmap.
 
 config/costmap_common.yaml-- Common parameters for costmap layers.
 
 config/global_costmap.yaml-- Parameters for the global costmap.
 
 config/move_base.yaml-- Parameters for the move base.
 
   
  You may need to modify these files to suit your robot's dimensions, sensor characteristics, and navigation requirements.
