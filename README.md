1. Introduction
This ROS package empowers your 4-wheel drive robot with autonomous navigation capabilities. Leveraging the AMCL algorithm, it accurately estimates the robot's pose within a map, enabling seamless navigation to specified goals while avoiding obstacles. The package includes configuration files, launch files, and scripts essential for integrating AMCL-based navigation into your robot system.

2. Prerequisites
Before diving into the package, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up:

ROS Noetic or a compatible ROS distribution.
Gazebo for simulating the robot (if applicable).
A functional ROS workspace for your robot project.
3. Installation
To install this package, follow these straightforward steps:

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/your/ros/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
4. Usage
Launching Navigation Stack
To kickstart the navigation stack with AMCL, employ the provided launch file:

bash
Copy code
roslaunch rmp01_bot_description navigation.launch
This launch file orchestrates the necessary nodes and configures the robot for navigation.

Teleoperation (Optional)
For testing purposes, teleoperate the robot with:

bash
Copy code
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
Setting Navigation Goals
Send navigation goals to the robot using tools like RViz or programmatically with ROS messages.

Visualizing in RViz
Launch RViz to visualize the robot's path and sensor data:

bash
Copy code
roslaunch rmp01_bot_description rviz.launch
In RViz, set navigation goals, monitor AMCL localization, and visualize the robot's perception.

5. Customization
This package serves as a robust starting point for your custom robot. Tailor various parameters in configuration files to align the navigation stack with your robot's hardware and sensor specifics.

Configuration Files
config/local_costmap.yaml: Parameters for the local costmap.
config/costmap_common.yaml: Common parameters for costmap layers.
config/global_costmap.yaml: Parameters for the global costmap.
config/move_base.yaml: Parameters for the move base.
Modify these files to suit your robot's dimensions, sensor characteristics, and navigation requirements.
